## Amazon-Recommenders
Cohort 13 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.



Recommendation engines are used by many organizations to suggest products to their customers. This can be seen with Netflix recommending shows and movies, Amazon recommending products, and Spotify recommending music. The goal of Team Amazon Recommendersâ€™ project is to build a book recommendation engine using Amazon customer review data. The recommendation engine should take a book as an input and recommend similar books to the users. Additionally, these recommendations should be displayed in a web application. Initial Amazon book review data is available for public use on AWS, with additional features available through web scraping. We used three different types of models to predict recommended books using the Amazon book data:  K-Nearest Neighbors, Singular Value Decomposition, and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization. The output of each model was then put into a Django App hosted on our AWS server for production.
